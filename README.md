# People Co - The largest solo-dev company management game ever.

## Ambitious? Absolutely!
There is a certain awe factor to magnitude and complexity when it comes to simulation / automation games.
This game will compute thousands of companies, and potentially millions of employees, inputs and outputs alongside quarterly valuations and government policy.
Workflows are developed by some resource entering a chain of employees or machines (and sometimes an employee operating a machine), calculating expense/yield and rendering the outcome daily.

To the average tycoon gamer, or life sim optomizer.. this game will hit the spot.
